Deprecate support for eggs for Python 3.11 or later, when the new ``importlib.metadata`` backend is used to load distribution metadata. This only affects the egg *distribution format* (with the ``.egg`` extension); distributions using the ``.egg-info`` *metadata format* (but are not actually eggs) are not affected. For more information about eggs, see `relevant section in the setuptools documentation <https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/stable/deprecated/python_eggs.html>`__.
